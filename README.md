# ToggleSwitch
Toggle switch provides users to select between two options.
# Note:
The appearance property is used to display an element using a platform-native 
styling based on the users' operating system's theme. 

Before we create a toggle switch, we need to hide our original checkbox.
For this, we use the ‘appearance’ property.
